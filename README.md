# 2022 Kaggle Data Science & Machine Learning Survey Analysis

## Overview

This notebook contains the analysis of the 2022 Kaggle Data Science & Machine Learning Survey dataset, specifically filtered to focus on respondents with the job title of "Data Scientist" located in the **USA**.

The Kaggle Survey provides valuable insights into the data science and machine learning community, including trends in tools, techniques, and methodologies used by professionals in the field. This analysis aims to uncover trends, preferences, and behaviors of data scientists working in the USA, helping us understand the landscape of the industry.

## Objective

The primary objective of this notebook is to:
- **Filter** the 2022 Kaggle survey data to include only respondents with the job title of **"Data Scientist"** and based in the **USA**.
- Analyze key aspects of their work, including:
  - Tools and technologies used
  - Industry preferences
  - Challenges faced in the field
  - Experience and educational background

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is from the **2022 Kaggle Data Science & Machine Learning Survey**, with responses collected from **multiple years** (2017-2022). For this project, we will focus on the 2022 data but may occasionally reference data from previous years for comparative insights.

The dataset contains information on:
- Respondent demographics (location, job title, education)
- Technical skills (programming languages, tools, libraries)
- Work-related statistics (work hours, job satisfaction)
- Survey responses on the state of the data science field.

## Data Filtering

In this specific notebook:
- We filter the data to include only **Data Scientists** in the **USA**.
- Additional filtering can be applied depending on personal interest (e.g., by **industry**, **education level**, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks
